# Documentation

The following is a collection of documentation I have written for quick reference.
Any queries or suggestions feel free to open an issue.

The project is based on [mkdocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/)

To run locally:

```
pip install mkdocs
cd docs (where you have the repo cloned locally)
mkdocs serve
```

To publish to GitHub Pages:

```
mkdocs gh-deploy
```
