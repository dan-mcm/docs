# AWS Route 53

## Amazons DNS Service

Allows you to map domain names to:

* EC2 instances
* Load balancers
* S3 buckets

## Lab Notes
* Register Domain on Route 53 (using namecheap use prefix.domain.com and match the namespace values)
* Create an A record set for the route 53 value. Use alias - clicking on Alias Target will provide dropdown where any pre-defined ELB/ALBs will appear
* You can setup a Load Balancer while in the EC2 dashboard - along left hand side you will see ‘Load Balancing’
* Once setup you can go to the domain and should be directed to your server
