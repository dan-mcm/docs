# AWS S3

Simple. Storage. Service.

S3 provides developers and IT teams with secure, durable, highly-scalable *object storage*.
Amazon S3 is easy to use with a simple web services interface to store and retrieve any amount
of data from anywhere on the web.

* S3 is a safe place to store your files.
* It is Object-based storage.
* The data is spread across multiple devices and facilities. (highly available)

## Basics

* S3 is Object-based - allows you to upload files.
* Files can be from 0 Bytes to 5 TB.
* There is unlimited storage.
* Files are stored in buckets (similar to a folder)
* S3 is a universal namespace. That is, names must be unique globally.
* Example: https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/acloudguru
* When you upload a file to S3, you will receive a HTTP 200 code if upload was successful.

## Data Consistency Model for S3

* Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new Objects (once object added to S3, the file is available to read)
* Eventual Consistent to overwrite PUTs and DELETEs (can take some time to propagate)

S3 is a Simple Key-Value Store
* S3 is Object based. Objects consist of the following:
    * Key (This is simply the name of the Object)
    * Value (This is simply the data, which is made up of a sequence of bytes).
    * Version ID (important for versioning)
    * Metadata (Data about data you are storing)
    * Subresources - bucket-specific configuration:
        * Bucket Policies, Access Control Lists
        * Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
        * Transfer Acceleration

## S3 - The Basics

* Built for 99.99% availability for the S3 platform.
* Amazon Guarantee 99.9% availability
* Amazon guarantees 99.999999999% (11x9s) durability for S3 information.
* Tiered Storage Available
* Lifecycle Management
* Versioning
* Encryption
* Secure your data - Access
    * Control Lists & Bucket Policies

## S3 - Storage Tiers/Classes

* S3 99.99% availability, 11x9s durability, stored redundantly across multiple devices
in multiple facilities, and is designed to sustain the loss of 2 facilities concurrently.      
* S3 - IA (Infrequently Accessed): For data that is accessed less frequently, but requires
rapid access when needed. Lower fee than S3, but you are charged a retrieval fee.
* S3 - One Zone IA: Same as IA however data is stored in a single Availability Zone only, still
11x9s durability, but only 99.5% availability. Cost is 20% less than regular S3-IA.
* Reduced Redundancy Storage: Designed to provide 99.99% durability and 99.99% availability
of objects over a given year. Used for data that can be recreated if lost, e.g. thumbnails
(Starting to disappear from AWS docs but may still feature in exam) - Standard cost now more effective than using this option.
* Glacier: Very cheap, but used for archival only. Optimised for data that is infrequently accessed and
it takes 3-5 hours to restore from Glacier.

## S3 - Intelligent Tiering (re-invent 2018)

* Unknown or unpredictable access patterns
* 2 tiers - frequent & infrequent access
* Automatically moves your data to most cost-effective tier based on how frequently you access each object - If object
is not accessed for 30 consecutive days moved to infrequent access, but if it is used moved to frequent access.
* 11x9s durability
* 99,9% availability over a given year.
* Optimizes Cost
* No fees for accessing your data but a small monthly fee for monitoring/automation $0.0025 per 1,000 objects.

## S3 - Charges

* Storage per GB
* Requests (Get, Put, Copy, etc.)
* Storage Management Pricing
    * Inventory, Analytics, Object Tags
* Data Management Pricing
    * Data Transferred out of S3
* Transfer Acceleration
    * Use of CloudFront to optimize transfers

## S3 Exam Tips

* Remember that S3 is Object-based i.e. allows you to upload files. Object-based storage only (for files.)
* Not suitable to install an OS or running a DB on.
* Files can be from 0 Bytes to 5 TB.
* There is unlimited storage.
* Files are stored in Buckets.
* S3 is a universal namespace. That is, names must be unique globally.
    * Example: https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/acloudguru
* Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new Objects
* Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (can take some time to propagate)
* S3 Storage Classes/Tiers
    * S3 [durable, immediately available, frequency accessed]
    * S3 - IA [durable, immediately available, infrequency accessed]
    * S3 - One Zone IA [same as IA however stored in single Availability Zone]
    * S3 Reduced Redundancy Storage [data that is easily reproducible i.e. thumbnails]
    * Glacier [Archived data, where you can wait 3-5 hours before accessing]
* Core fundamentals of S3 Object:
    * Key (name)
    * Value (data)
    * Version ID
    * Metadata
    * Subresources - bucket-specific config:
        * Bucket Policies, Access Control Lists
        * Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
        * Transfer Acceleration
* Successful uploads will generate  HTTP 200 status code - when you use CLI/API
* Make sure you read the S3 FAQ: https://aws.amazon.com/s3/faqs/
