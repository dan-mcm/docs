# Step Functions

Step functions allow you to visualize and test your serverless applications.
Step Functions provides a graphical console to arrange and visualize components of your applicaiton as a series of steps.
This makes it simple to build and run multistep applications. Step Functions automatically triggers and tracks each step,
and retries when there are errors, so your application executes in order and as expected. Step Functions logs the state
of each step, so when things do go wrong, you can diagnose and debug problems quickly.

* Sequential Steps
* Branching Steps (Choice of Path)
* Parallel Steps

Note: Under Application Integrations on AWS (not Lambda)
Uses JSON-based Amazon State Language.
