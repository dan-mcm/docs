## What are these docs and who are they for?


(Me) => {

  - Making notes & resources helps me concrete my own knowledge.
  - Docs provide a useful and quick reference for day to day work.
  - An excuse to experiment with a new documentation library.

}

(You) => {

  - Maybe there is some useful knowledge in here relating to a language or tech concept that will help
  - Maybe you would like to adopt something similar for your own purposes and will use this as a template

}

## Why am I using mkdocs?

It's quick and easy.
I wanted to have a docs page I can quickly update when the mood strikes.

Being able to update the documentation using markdown and not worrying about custom styling and css is crucial to achieve this.
Once I have my knowledge solidified in a markdown structure I may consider switching to something like Gatsby or Hugo.

Having previously designed page search functionality, it's also so much easier to use a pre-made solution like mkdocs that has search integrated.
There's no point having all these resources if I can't search for what I need quickly and efficiently now is there?
